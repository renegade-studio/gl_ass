# Feature Specification: Search and Replace

## Feature Identity
- **Feature ID**: [FEAT-007]
- **Feature Name**: Search and Replace
- **Epic/Theme**: Core Editor
- **Priority**: High
- **Estimated Effort**: Medium

## Alignment with Philosophy
- **Pillar 2: Zero-Friction DX**: A fast and powerful search and replace feature is essential for a zero-friction developer experience.

## Business Context
### User Story
**As a** developer
**I want** to be able to quickly find and replace text in my files
**So that** I can make changes to my codebase efficiently.

### Business Value
- **Problem**: Manually finding and replacing text is tedious and error-prone.
- **Solution**: A powerful and efficient search and replace engine that supports regular expressions, case sensitivity, and whole word matching.
- **Impact**: A more productive and enjoyable development experience.

### Success Criteria
- Users can search for and replace text in the current file and across the entire project.
- The search and replace engine is fast and responsive, even when working with large files and projects.
- The search and replace engine supports regular expressions, case sensitivity, and whole word matching.

## Functional Requirements
### Core Functionality
1. **Search**:
   - Input: A search query and a set of options (e.g., regular expression, case sensitivity).
   - Processing: Search for the query in the current file or across the entire project.
   - Output: A list of matches is displayed to the user.
2. **Replace**:
   - Input: A replacement string.
   - Processing: Replace the matches with the replacement string.
   - Output: The files are updated with the new content.

## Technical Requirements
- **Architecture**: The search and replace feature will be implemented as a separate service that communicates with the core editor via the Model Context Protocol (MCP).
- **Search Engine**: A high-performance search engine will be used to search for text in files.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: Search and replace operations should be fast and non-blocking.

## Implementation Guidelines
- The search and replace service will be implemented as a Gleam application.
- The search engine will be designed to be extensible, allowing new search strategies to be added easily.

## Edge Cases and Error Scenarios
- The search and replace feature should handle large files and projects efficiently.
- The search and replace feature should handle binary files gracefully.

## Acceptance Criteria
- A comprehensive test suite for the search and replace service.
- A successful integration of the search and replace service with the core editor.

## Dependencies and Constraints
- The project will depend on a high-performance search engine.

## Rollout Strategy
- **Phase 1:** The goal for Phase 1 is to achieve 1:1 parity with the search and replace feature of the original Atom editor.
- **Phase 2:** In Phase 2, we will focus on implementing advanced search and replace features, such as structural search and replace.

### Deprecation Plan
- Not applicable.
