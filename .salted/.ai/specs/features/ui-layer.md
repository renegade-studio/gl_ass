# Feature Specification: UI Layer

## Feature Identity
- **Feature ID**: [FEAT-002]
- **Feature Name**: UI Layer
- **Epic/Theme**: Core Editor
- **Priority**: High
- **Estimated Effort**: Large

## Business Context
### User Story
**As a** developer
**I want** a beautiful, intuitive, and customizable user interface
**So that** I can have a pleasant and productive coding experience.

### Business Value
- **Problem**: Many text editors have cluttered and unintuitive user interfaces.
- **Solution**: A clean, modern, and component-based UI layer that is GPU-accelerated for maximum performance.
- **Impact**: A more enjoyable and efficient coding environment, leading to increased user adoption and satisfaction.

### Success Criteria
- The UI is rendered smoothly and without any tearing or flickering.
- The UI is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes and resolutions.
- Users can customize the look and feel of the editor through a flexible theming system.

## Functional Requirements
### Core Functionality
1. **Window and View Management**:
   - Input: User commands to open, close, split, and resize views.
   - Processing: Manage the layout of the editor window and its views.
   - Output: The UI is updated to reflect the new layout.
2. **Component-Based Rendering**:
   - Input: Data from the core editor engine and other components.
   - Processing: Render the UI using a set of reusable components (e.g., tabs, status bar, tree view).
   - Output: The UI is displayed to the user.
3. **Theming**:
   - Input: A theme file with a set of colors and styles.
   - Processing: Apply the theme to the UI components.
   - Output: The look and feel of the editor is updated.

## Technical Requirements
- **Architecture**: The UI will be web-based, rendered in a native web view. This will allow us to leverage the power and flexibility of modern web technologies.
- **Web Framework**: A modern web framework like React, Vue, or Svelte will be used to build the UI. The choice of framework will be made based on a separate evaluation.
- **Web View Library**: A lightweight web view library will be used to host the web-based UI. The choice of library will be made based on a separate evaluation.
- **Communication**: The UI layer will communicate with the Gleam backend via a well-defined API (e.g., using WebSockets or a custom RPC protocol).
- **Rendering Engine**: The rendering of the UI will be GPU-accelerated by the underlying web view library.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: The UI should be highly responsive and have a low memory footprint.
- **Accessibility**: The UI should be accessible to users with disabilities, following the WCAG 2.1 guidelines.
- **Theming**: The theming system should be flexible and allow users to customize all aspects of the UI.

## Implementation Guidelines
- The UI will be built as a single-page application (SPA).
- The UI components will be designed to be reusable and modular.
- The communication between the UI and the backend will be asynchronous and non-blocking.

## Edge Cases and Error Scenarios
- The UI should handle backend errors gracefully and display informative error messages to the user.
- The UI should handle slow network connections gracefully.

## Acceptance Criteria
- A set of UI components for all the core features of the editor.
- A comprehensive test suite for the UI components.
- A successful integration of the UI layer with the Gleam backend.

## Dependencies and Constraints
- The project will depend on a web framework and a web view library.
- The choice of web framework and web view library will have a significant impact on the project.

## Rollout Strategy
- The UI layer will be developed and tested in isolation before being integrated with the rest of the editor.
- The UI components will be developed and tested one by one.
