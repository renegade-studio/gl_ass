# Feature Specification: Language Server Protocol (LSP) Client

## Feature Identity
- **Feature ID**: [FEAT-005]
- **Feature Name**: Language Server Protocol (LSP) Client
- **Epic/Theme**: Core Editor
- **Priority**: High
- **Estimated Effort**: Medium

## Business Context
### User Story
**As a** developer
**I want** to have rich language features like autocompletion, diagnostics, and go-to-definition
**So that** I can write code more efficiently and with fewer errors.

### Business Value
- **Problem**: Implementing language-specific features for every language is a huge amount of work.
- **Solution**: A client for the Language Server Protocol (LSP), which allows the editor to communicate with language servers that provide language-specific features.
- **Impact**: The editor can support a wide range of languages with minimal effort, by leveraging the existing ecosystem of language servers.

### Success Criteria
- The editor can communicate with language servers that implement the LSP.
- The editor provides rich language features like autocompletion, diagnostics, and go-to-definition.
- The LSP client is reliable and does not degrade the performance of the editor.

## Functional Requirements
### Core Functionality
1. **LSP Communication**:
   - Input: A language server to connect to.
   - Processing: Establish a connection with the language server and exchange messages according to the LSP.
   - Output: The editor can send requests to the language server and receive responses and notifications.
2. **Language Features**:
   - Input: User actions (e.g., typing, hovering over a symbol).
   - Processing: Send requests to the language server to get information about the code (e.g., autocompletions, diagnostics).
   - Output: The information from the language server is displayed to the user in the editor.
