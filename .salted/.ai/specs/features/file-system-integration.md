# Feature Specification: File System Integration

## Feature Identity
- **Feature ID**: [FEAT-003]
- **Feature Name**: File System Integration
- **Epic/Theme**: Core Editor
- **Priority**: High
- **Estimated Effort**: Medium

## Alignment with Philosophy
- **Pillar 2: Zero-Friction DX**: A fast and reliable file system integration is essential for a zero-friction developer experience.
- **Pillar 4: BEAM-Powered Reliability**: The file system integration will be implemented as a separate service, ensuring that file system errors do not crash the editor.

## Business Context
### User Story
**As a** developer
**I want** to be able to easily open, save, and manage my files
**So that** I can work efficiently on my projects.

### Business Value
- **Problem**: Poor file system integration can make it difficult and time-consuming to work with files.
- **Solution**: A robust and efficient file system integration that provides seamless access to the local file system.
- **Impact**: A more productive and enjoyable development experience.

### Success Criteria
- Users can open and save files without any errors or data loss.
- The file tree view accurately reflects the state of the file system.
- The editor automatically detects and reloads files that have been changed on disk.

## Functional Requirements
### Core Functionality
1. **File I/O**:
   - Input: User commands to open and save files.
   - Processing: Read and write files to the local file system.
   - Output: The content of the file is displayed in the editor, or the editor's content is saved to the file.
2. **File Tree View**:
   - Input: A path to a directory.
   - Processing: Scan the directory and its subdirectories to build a tree structure.
   - Output: The tree structure is displayed to the user in a browsable view.
3. **File Watching**:
   - Input: A list of open files and directories.
   - Processing: Watch the files and directories for changes on disk.
   - Output: The editor is notified of any changes, and the UI is updated accordingly.

## Technical Requirements
- **Architecture**: The file system integration will be implemented as a separate service that communicates with the core editor via the Model Context Protocol (MCP).
- **File Watching**: A high-performance file watching library will be used to monitor the file system for changes.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: File system operations should be fast and non-blocking.
- **Reliability**: The file system integration should be reliable and not lose data.

## Implementation Guidelines
- The file system service will be implemented as a Gleam application.
- The file system service will expose a well-defined API for the core editor to interact with.

## Edge Cases and Error Scenarios
- The file system service should handle file system errors gracefully (e.g., file not found, permission denied).
- The file system service should handle large directories and a large number of files efficiently.

## Acceptance Criteria
- A comprehensive test suite for the file system service.
- A successful integration of the file system service with the core editor.

## Dependencies and Constraints
- The project will depend on a file watching library.

## Rollout Strategy
- **Phase 1:** The goal for Phase 1 is to achieve 1:1 parity with the file system integration of the original Atom editor. This includes features like opening and saving files, the file tree view, and file watching.
- **Phase 2:** In Phase 2, we will focus on implementing advanced file system features, such as remote file system support.

### Deprecation Plan
- Not applicable.
