# Feature Specification: Version Control (Git) Integration

## Feature Identity
- **Feature ID**: [FEAT-009]
- **Feature Name**: Version Control (Git) Integration
- **Epic/Theme**: Core Editor
- **Priority**: High
- **Estimated Effort**: Large

## Business Context
### User Story
**As a** developer
**I want** to be able to interact with my Git repository from within the editor
**So that** I can manage my code changes more efficiently.

### Business Value
- **Problem**: Switching between the editor and a separate Git client can be disruptive and inefficient.
- **Solution**: An integrated Git client that provides a seamless experience for managing code changes.
- **Impact**: A more streamlined and productive development workflow.

### Success Criteria
- Users can see the Git status of their files in the editor.
- Users can view diffs of their changes.
- Users can stage, commit, push, and pull changes from within the editor.

## Functional Requirements
### Core Functionality
1. **Git Status**:
   - Input: The current state of the Git repository.
   - Processing: Determine the Git status of each file (e.g., modified, new, deleted).
   - Output: The Git status is displayed to the user in the file tree view and the editor.
2. **Diff View**:
   - Input: A file with changes.
   - Processing: Compare the current version of the file with the version in the Git repository.
   - Output: The diff is displayed to the user in a side-by-side view.
3. **Git Commands**:
   - Input: User commands to stage, commit, push, and pull changes.
   - Processing: Run the corresponding Git commands.
   - Output: The Git repository is updated and the UI is updated to reflect the new state.
