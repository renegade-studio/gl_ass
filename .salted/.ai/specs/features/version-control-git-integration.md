# Feature Specification: Version Control (Git) Integration

## Feature Identity
- **Feature ID**: [FEAT-009]
- **Feature Name**: Version Control (Git) Integration
- **Epic/Theme**: Core Editor
- **Priority**: High
- **Estimated Effort**: Large

## Alignment with Philosophy
- **Pillar 2: Zero-Friction DX**: A seamless Git integration is essential for a zero-friction developer experience.
- **Pillar 3: Time-Shifted Collaboration**: The Git integration will be designed to work seamlessly with the real-time collaboration features.

## Business Context
### User Story
**As a** developer
**I want** to be able to interact with my Git repository from within the editor
**So that** I can manage my code changes more efficiently.

### Business Value
- **Problem**: Switching between the editor and a separate Git client can be disruptive and inefficient.
- **Solution**: An integrated Git client that provides a seamless experience for managing code changes.
- **Impact**: A more streamlined and productive development workflow.

### Success Criteria
- Users can see the Git status of their files in the editor.
- Users can view diffs of their changes.
- Users can stage, commit, push, and pull changes from within the editor.

## Functional Requirements
### Core Functionality
1. **Git Status**:
   - Input: The current state of the Git repository.
   - Processing: Determine the Git status of each file (e.g., modified, new, deleted).
   - Output: The Git status is displayed to the user in the file tree view and the editor.
2. **Diff View**:
   - Input: A file with changes.
   - Processing: Compare the current version of the file with the version in the Git repository.
   - Output: The diff is displayed to the user in a side-by-side view.
3. **Git Commands**:
   - Input: User commands to stage, commit, push, and pull changes.
   - Processing: Run the corresponding Git commands.
   - Output: The Git repository is updated and the UI is updated to reflect the new state.

## Technical Requirements
- **Architecture**: The Git integration will be implemented as a separate service that communicates with the core editor via the Model Context Protocol (MCP).
- **Git Library**: A Gleam library for Git will be used to interact with Git repositories.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: Git operations should be fast and non-blocking.
- **Reliability**: The Git integration should be reliable and not corrupt the user's Git repository.

## Implementation Guidelines
- The Git service will be implemented as a Gleam application.
- The Git integration will be designed to be extensible, allowing new Git features to be added easily.

## Edge Cases and Error Scenarios
- The Git integration should handle Git errors gracefully (e.g., merge conflicts).
- The Git integration should handle large repositories efficiently.

## Acceptance Criteria
- A comprehensive test suite for the Git service.
- A successful integration of the Git service with the core editor.

## Dependencies and Constraints
- The project will depend on a Gleam library for Git.

## Rollout Strategy
- **Phase 1:** The goal for Phase 1 is to achieve 1:1 parity with the Git integration of the original Atom editor.
- **Phase 2:** In Phase 2, we will focus on implementing advanced Git features, such as interactive rebase and a full-featured branch management UI.

### Deprecation Plan
- Not applicable.
