# Feature Specification: Extensibility/Plugin System

## Feature Identity
- **Feature ID**: [FEAT-004]
- **Feature Name**: Extensibility/Plugin System
- **Epic/Theme**: Core Editor
- **Priority**: High
- **Estimated Effort**: Large

## Alignment with Philosophy
- **Pillar 1: Symbiotic AI Core**: The plugin system will be designed to allow AI agents to be implemented as plugins.
- **Pillar 2: Zero-Friction DX**: A powerful and easy-to-use plugin system is essential for a zero-friction developer experience.
- **Pillar 4: BEAM-Powered Reliability**: Plugins will be run in separate processes, preventing them from crashing the editor.

## Business Context
### User Story
**As a** developer
**I want** to be able to extend the functionality of the editor with plugins
**So that** I can customize the editor to my specific needs and workflows.

### Business Value
- **Problem**: A monolithic editor cannot cater to the diverse needs of all developers.
- **Solution**: A powerful and flexible plugin system that allows developers to add new features and functionality to the editor.
- **Impact**: A vibrant ecosystem of community-developed plugins that make the editor more powerful and versatile.

### Success Criteria
- Developers can create and publish plugins for the editor.
- Users can easily install, update, and manage plugins.
- The plugin system is stable and does not compromise the performance or security of the editor.

## Functional Requirements
### Core Functionality
1. **Plugin API**:
   - Input: A set of well-defined APIs for extending the editor's functionality.
   - Processing: Allow plugins to access and modify the editor's state and behavior.
   - Output: Plugins can add new commands, UI components, and language features to the editor.
2. **Package Manager**:
   - Input: A tool for managing plugins.
   - Processing: Allow users to install, update, and remove plugins from a central repository.
   - Output: The user's set of installed plugins is updated.
3. **Plugin Isolation**:
   - Input: A mechanism for isolating plugins from each other and from the core editor.
   - Processing: Run plugins in separate processes to prevent them from interfering with each other or with the core editor.
   - Output: The editor remains stable and performant even with a large number of plugins installed.

## Technical Requirements
- **Architecture**: Plugins will be implemented as separate processes that communicate with the core editor via the Model Context Protocol (MCP). Each plugin will run as an MCP server.
- **Plugin API**: The Plugin API will be defined as a set of MCP services and messages.
- **Sandboxing**: Plugins will be run in a sandboxed environment to prevent them from accessing the user's system without permission.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: The plugin system should have a low overhead and not degrade the performance of the editor.
- **Security**: The plugin system should be secure and protect users from malicious plugins.

## Implementation Guidelines
- The plugin host will be implemented as a Gleam application that is responsible for managing the lifecycle of plugins.
- The Plugin API will be designed to be easy to use and well-documented.

## Edge Cases and Error Scenarios
- The plugin host should handle plugin crashes gracefully.
- The plugin host should handle slow or unresponsive plugins gracefully.

## Acceptance Criteria
- A comprehensive test suite for the plugin host and the Plugin API.
- A successful integration of the plugin system with the core editor.

## Dependencies and Constraints
- The project will depend on the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

## Rollout Strategy
- **Phase 1:** The goal for Phase 1 is to achieve 1:1 parity with the plugin system of the original Atom editor. This includes the ability to create, publish, install, and manage plugins.
- **Phase 2:** In Phase 2, we will focus on implementing advanced plugin features, such as a more sophisticated sandboxing model and a richer Plugin API.

### Deprecation Plan
- Not applicable.
