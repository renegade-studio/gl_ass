# Feature Specification: Extensibility/Plugin System

## Feature Identity
- **Feature ID**: [FEAT-004]
- **Feature Name**: Extensibility/Plugin System
- **Epic/Theme**: Core Editor
- **Priority**: High
- **Estimated Effort**: Large

## Business Context
### User Story
**As a** developer
**I want** to be able to extend the functionality of the editor with plugins
**So that** I can customize the editor to my specific needs and workflows.

### Business Value
- **Problem**: A monolithic editor cannot cater to the diverse needs of all developers.
- **Solution**: A powerful and flexible plugin system that allows developers to add new features and functionality to the editor.
- **Impact**: A vibrant ecosystem of community-developed plugins that make the editor more powerful and versatile.

### Success Criteria
- Developers can create and publish plugins for the editor.
- Users can easily install, update, and manage plugins.
- The plugin system is stable and does not compromise the performance or security of the editor.

## Functional Requirements
### Core Functionality
1. **Plugin API**:
   - Input: A set of well-defined APIs for extending the editor's functionality.
   - Processing: Allow plugins to access and modify the editor's state and behavior.
   - Output: Plugins can add new commands, UI components, and language features to the editor.
2. **Package Manager**:
   - Input: A tool for managing plugins.
   - Processing: Allow users to install, update, and remove plugins from a central repository.
   - Output: The user's set of installed plugins is updated.
3. **Plugin Isolation**:
   - Input: A mechanism for isolating plugins from each other and from the core editor.
   - Processing: Run plugins in a sandboxed environment to prevent them from interfering with each other or with the core editor.
   - Output: The editor remains stable and performant even with a large number of plugins installed.
