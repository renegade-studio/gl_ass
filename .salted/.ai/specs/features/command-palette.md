# Feature Specification: Command Palette

## Feature Identity
- **Feature ID**: [FEAT-006]
- **Feature Name**: Command Palette
- **Epic/Theme**: Core Editor
- **Priority**: High
- **Estimated Effort**: Medium

## Alignment with Philosophy
- **Pillar 2: Zero-Friction DX**: The command palette is a key feature for a zero-friction developer experience, as it provides a quick and easy way to access all of the editor's commands.

## Business Context
### User Story
**As a** developer
**I want** to be able to quickly find and run any command in the editor
**So that** I can work more efficiently without having to remember complex keybindings or navigate through menus.

### Business Value
- **Problem**: It can be difficult to discover and access all of the features of a powerful text editor.
- **Solution**: A command palette that provides a single, searchable interface for all of the editor's commands.
- **Impact**: A more discoverable and efficient user experience, especially for new users.

### Success Criteria
- The command palette can be opened with a single keybinding.
- Users can search for and run any command in the editor.
- The command palette is fast and responsive.

## Functional Requirements
### Core Functionality
1. **Command Discovery**:
   - Input: A list of all available commands in the editor.
   - Processing: Display the commands in a searchable list.
   - Output: The user can see all of the available commands.
2. **Command Execution**:
   - Input: A command selected by the user.
   - Processing: Run the selected command.
   - Output: The command is executed and the editor's state is updated.

## Technical Requirements
- **Architecture**: The command palette will be implemented as a UI component that communicates with the core editor via the Model Context Protocol (MCP).
- **Command Registry**: A central registry will be used to store all of the available commands.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: The command palette should be fast and responsive, even with a large number of commands.

## Implementation Guidelines
- The command palette will be implemented as a reusable UI component.
- The command registry will be designed to be extensible, allowing plugins to add new commands.

## Edge Cases and Error Scenarios
- The command palette should handle cases where no commands match the user's search query.

## Acceptance Criteria
- A comprehensive test suite for the command palette.
- A successful integration of the command palette with the core editor.

## Dependencies and Constraints
- The project will depend on the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

## Rollout Strategy
- **Phase 1:** The goal for Phase 1 is to achieve 1:1 parity with the command palette of the original Atom editor.
- **Phase 2:** In Phase 2, we will focus on implementing advanced command palette features, such as a more sophisticated ranking algorithm and support for fuzzy search.

### Deprecation Plan
- Not applicable.
