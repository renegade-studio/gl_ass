# Feature Specification: Terminal Integration

## Feature Identity
- **Feature ID**: [FEAT-008]
- **Feature Name**: Terminal Integration
- **Epic/Theme**: Core Editor
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Estimated Effort**: Medium

## Alignment with Philosophy
- **Pillar 2: Zero-Friction DX**: An integrated terminal is a key feature for a zero-friction developer experience, as it allows developers to run commands without having to switch to a separate terminal application.

## Business Context
### User Story
**As a** developer
**I want** to have an integrated terminal within the editor
**So that** I can run commands without having to switch to a separate terminal application.

### Business Value
- **Problem**: Switching between the editor and a separate terminal application can be disruptive and inefficient.
- **Solution**: An integrated terminal that provides a full-featured terminal experience within the editor.
- **Impact**: A more streamlined and productive development workflow.

### Success Criteria
- Users can open and use a terminal within the editor.
- The integrated terminal is fast, reliable, and supports all the features of a standard terminal.

## Functional Requirements
### Core Functionality
1. **Terminal Emulation**:
   - Input: User input from the keyboard.
   - Processing: Emulate a standard terminal and run a shell (e.g., bash, zsh).
   - Output: The output of the shell is displayed to the user in the terminal view.
2. **Terminal Management**:
   - Input: User commands to create, switch between, and close terminals.
   - Processing: Manage multiple terminal sessions.
   - Output: The UI is updated to reflect the current set of terminal sessions.

## Technical Requirements
- **Architecture**: The terminal integration will be implemented as a separate service that communicates with the core editor via the Model Context Protocol (MCP).
- **Terminal Emulator**: A high-performance terminal emulator will be used to render the terminal view.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: The integrated terminal should be fast and responsive.
- **Reliability**: The integrated terminal should be reliable and not crash.

## Implementation Guidelines
- The terminal service will be implemented as a Gleam application.
- The terminal emulator will be implemented as a reusable UI component.

## Edge Cases and Error Scenarios
- The terminal integration should handle shell crashes gracefully.

## Acceptance Criteria
- A comprehensive test suite for the terminal service and the terminal emulator.
- A successful integration of the terminal integration with the core editor.

## Dependencies and Constraints
- The project will depend on a terminal emulator library.

## Rollout Strategy
- **Phase 1:** The goal for Phase 1 is to achieve 1:1 parity with the terminal integration of the original Atom editor.
- **Phase 2:** In Phase 2, we will focus on implementing advanced terminal features, such as split terminals and search.

### Deprecation Plan
- Not applicable.
