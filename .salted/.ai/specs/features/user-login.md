# Feature Specification: User Login

## Feature Identity
- **Feature ID**: [FEAT-002]
- **Feature Name**: User Login
- **Epic/Theme**: User Authentication
- **Priority**: High
- **Estimated Effort**: Medium
- **Design Doc**: [Link to design document]

## Business Context
### User Story
**As a** user
**I want** to be able to log in to my account
**So that** I can access my personalized content and settings.

### Business Value
- **Problem**: Users need a secure and easy way to access their accounts.
- **Solution**: A login feature that allows users to authenticate with their email and password.
- **Impact**: Increased user engagement and retention.

### Success Criteria
- Users can successfully log in with their correct credentials.
- Users see an error message when they enter incorrect credentials.
- The login process is secure and protects user data.

## Functional Requirements
### Core Functionality
1. **Login Form**:
   - Input: User enters their email and password.
   - Processing: The UI validates the input and sends it to the backend.
   - Output: The user is logged in and redirected to their dashboard.
2. **Authentication**:
   - Input: Email and password from the login form.
   - Processing: The backend verifies the credentials against the user database.
   - Output: A JSON Web Token (JWT) is returned to the client.
3. **Error Handling**:
   - Input: Incorrect credentials or other errors.
   - Processing: The backend returns an error message.
   - Output: The error message is displayed to the user.

## Technical Requirements
### API Specifications
```yaml
# POST /api/v1/login
Request:
  Content-Type: application/json
  Body:
    email: string (required)
    password: string (required)
Response:
  200: OK
    Body:
      token: string (JWT)
  401: Unauthorized
    Body:
      error: string
```

### Database Changes
- No new tables are required.
- The `users` table will be used for authentication.

### Integration Points
- This feature will integrate with the user registration feature.

## Non-Functional Requirements
### Performance
- The login process should be completed in under 500ms.
### Security
- Passwords must be hashed and salted before being stored in the database.
- The login endpoint must be protected against brute-force attacks.

## Implementation Guidelines
### Architecture Patterns
- The backend will follow a RESTful architecture.
- The authentication logic will be implemented in a separate service.

### Test Plan
- **Unit Tests**:
  - Test the authentication service with valid and invalid credentials.
  - Test the login endpoint with valid and invalid requests.
- **Integration Tests**:
  - Test the entire login flow, from the UI to the backend.

### Development Tasks
1. Implement the login endpoint.
2. Implement the authentication service.
3. Create the login form in the UI.

## Edge Cases and Error Scenarios
- The user enters an invalid email format.
- The user enters a password that is too short.
- The user's account is locked.

## Acceptance Criteria
### Definition of Done
- [ ] The login endpoint is implemented and tested.
- [ ] The authentication service is implemented and tested.
- [ ] The login form is implemented and tested.
- [ ] The login process is secure and performant.

### Test Scenarios
```gherkin
Feature: User Login

Scenario: Successful login
  Given a user with the email "test@example.com" and password "password"
  When the user enters their email and password in the login form
  Then the user is logged in and redirected to their dashboard

Scenario: Unsuccessful login
  Given a user with the email "test@example.com" and password "password"
  When the user enters an incorrect password in the login form
  Then the user sees an error message
```

## Dependencies and Constraints
- The user registration feature must be implemented first.

## Rollout Strategy
- This feature will be released as part of the initial launch of the application.

### Deprecation Plan
- Not applicable.
