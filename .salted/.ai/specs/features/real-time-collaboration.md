# Feature Specification: Real-time Collaboration

## Feature Identity
- **Feature ID**: [FEAT-010]
- **Feature Name**: Real-time Collaboration
- **Epic/Theme**: Core Editor
- **Priority**: High
- **Estimated Effort**: Large

## Alignment with Philosophy
- **Pillar 3: Time-Shifted Collaboration**: This feature is the cornerstone of the "Time-Shifted Collaboration" pillar.
- **Pillar 4: BEAM-Powered Reliability**: The real-time collaboration feature will be built on the BEAM to ensure maximum reliability and scalability.

## Business Context
### User Story
**As a** developer
**I want** to be able to collaborate with my team in real-time
**So that** we can work together more effectively on the same codebase.

### Business Value
- **Problem**: Traditional development workflows can be slow and inefficient for remote teams.
- **Solution**: A real-time collaboration feature that allows multiple developers to work on the same files at the same time.
- **Impact**: A more collaborative and productive development experience, especially for remote teams.

### Success Criteria
- Multiple users can edit the same files at the same time.
- Changes are synchronized between users in real-time.
- The collaboration feature is reliable and does not cause data loss.

## Functional Requirements
### Core Functionality
1. **Shared Workspace**:
   - Input: A workspace to share with other users.
   - Processing: Allow multiple users to join the same workspace.
   - Output: All users in the workspace can see the same files and directories.
2. **Real-time Editing**:
   - Input: Changes from multiple users.
   - Processing: Use a CRDT-based algorithm to merge changes from multiple users in real-time.
   - Output: The changes are synchronized between all users in the workspace.
3. **Communication Tools**:
   - Input: Integrated voice and screen sharing.
   - Processing: Allow users to communicate with each other from within the editor.
   - Output: A more collaborative and immersive development experience.

## Technical Requirements
- **Architecture**: The real-time collaboration feature will be implemented as a separate service that communicates with the core editor via the Model Context Protocol (MCP).
- **CRDT Library**: A Gleam library for Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) will be used to handle real-time editing.
- **WebRTC**: WebRTC will be used for peer-to-peer communication between clients.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: The real-time collaboration feature should have low latency and not degrade the performance of the editor.
- **Scalability**: The real-time collaboration feature should be able to support a large number of concurrent users.

## Implementation Guidelines
- The collaboration service will be implemented as a Gleam application.
- The real-time collaboration feature will be designed to be extensible, allowing new collaboration features to be added easily.

## Edge Cases and Error Scenarios
- The real-time collaboration feature should handle network partitions gracefully.
- The real-time collaboration feature should handle users joining and leaving the session gracefully.

## Acceptance Criteria
- A comprehensive test suite for the collaboration service.
- A successful integration of the collaboration service with the core editor.

## Dependencies and Constraints
- The project will depend on a Gleam library for CRDTs and WebRTC.

## Rollout Strategy
- **Phase 2:** This feature will be implemented in Phase 2, as it is not part of the 1:1 parity with Atom goal for Phase 1.

### Deprecation Plan
- Not applicable.
