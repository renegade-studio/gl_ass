# Feature Specification: Core Editor Engine

## Feature Identity
- **Feature ID**: [FEAT-001]
- **Feature Name**: Core Editor Engine
- **Epic/Theme**: Core Editor
- **Priority**: High
- **Estimated Effort**: Large

## Alignment with Philosophy
- **Pillar 1: Symbiotic AI Core**: A high-performance core editor engine is a prerequisite for a responsive AI experience.
- **Pillar 2: Zero-Friction DX**: The performance and reliability of the core editor engine are critical for a zero-friction developer experience.
- **Pillar 3: Time-Shifted Collaboration**: The core editor engine must be designed to support real-time collaboration.
- **Pillar 4: BEAM-Powered Reliability**: The core editor engine will be built on the BEAM to ensure maximum reliability and fault-tolerance.

## Business Context
### User Story
**As a** developer
**I want** a fast, responsive, and reliable core editor engine
**So that** I can edit code without any perceptible lag and with confidence that my work is safe.

### Business Value
- **Problem**: Traditional text editors can be slow and unresponsive, especially when working with large files.
- **Solution**: A high-performance editor engine built in Gleam, using modern data structures and algorithms.
- **Impact**: A significantly improved developer experience, leading to increased productivity and satisfaction.

### Success Criteria
- The editor can open and edit large files (e.g., >10MB) without any noticeable lag.
- Basic editing operations (insert, delete, undo/redo) are instantaneous.
- The editor provides accurate and incremental syntax highlighting.

## Functional Requirements
### Core Functionality
1. **Text Storage**:
   - Input: Text from a file or user input.
   - Processing: Store the text in a memory-efficient data structure like a rope.
   - Output: The text is available for editing and rendering.
2. **Editing Operations**:
   - Input: User input (keystrokes, mouse events).
   - Processing: Perform editing operations (insert, delete, etc.) on the text data structure.
   - Output: The text is updated and the changes are reflected in the UI.
3. **Syntax Highlighting**:
   - Input: The text and a grammar definition.
   - Processing: Use a fast parsing library like Tree-sitter to parse the text and generate a syntax tree.
   - Output: The syntax tree is available for rendering with different colors and styles.
4. **Undo/Redo**:
   - Input: User commands to undo or redo changes.
   - Processing: Maintain a history of changes and apply them to the text data structure.
   - Output: The text is reverted to a previous state.

## Technical Requirements
- **Text Storage**: A custom rope data structure will be implemented in Gleam. This data structure will be designed for high performance and memory efficiency.
- **Syntax Highlighting**: The editor will use Tree-sitter for parsing and syntax highlighting. We will use the existing `tree-sitter-gleam` grammar for Gleam code, and we will create a Gleam wrapper for the Tree-sitter library to integrate it with the editor.
- **API**: The core editor engine will expose a well-defined API for the UI layer and other components to interact with. This API will be asynchronous and non-blocking to ensure a responsive UI.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**:
  - Opening a 10MB file should take less than 100ms.
  - Basic editing operations should be completed in under 16ms (i.e., within a single frame at 60fps).
- **Reliability**: The editor engine should be robust and not crash or lose data, even when working with large files or complex editing operations.
- **Scalability**: The editor engine should be able to handle files of any size, limited only by the available memory.

## Implementation Guidelines
### Architecture Patterns
- The core editor engine will be implemented as a self-contained system.
- The rope data structure will be implemented as a persistent data structure to allow for efficient undo/redo functionality.
- The Tree-sitter wrapper will be implemented as a NIF (Native Implemented Function) to allow Gleam to call the C-based Tree-sitter library.
- The API will be designed with a focus on performance and ease of use.

### Test Plan
- **Unit Tests**:
  - A comprehensive test suite for the rope data structure.
  - Unit tests for all public functions in the core editor engine.
- **Integration Tests**:
  - Integration tests for the core editor engine and the UI layer.
- **Benchmarks**:
  - A set of benchmarks to measure the performance of the editor engine.

## Edge Cases and Error Scenarios
- The editor should handle files with very long lines gracefully.
- The editor should handle files with mixed encodings.
- The editor should handle out-of-memory errors gracefully.

## Acceptance Criteria
### Definition of Done
- [ ] The core editor engine is implemented and tested.
- [ ] The core editor engine meets the performance targets.
- [ ] The core editor engine is successfully integrated with the UI layer.

## Dependencies and Constraints
- The project will depend on the Tree-sitter library and the `tree-sitter-gleam` grammar.
- The implementation of the rope data structure and the Tree-sitter wrapper will be a significant undertaking and will require careful design and implementation.

## Rollout Strategy
- **Phase 1:** The goal for Phase 1 is to achieve 1:1 parity with the core editor engine of the original Atom editor. This includes features like text storage, editing operations, syntax highlighting, and undo/redo.
- **Phase 2:** In Phase 2, we will focus on implementing the advanced features of the `gl_ass` vision, such as the "Symbiotic" AI Core.

### Deprecation Plan
- Not applicable.
