# Feature Specification: Core Editor Engine

## Feature Identity
- **Feature ID**: [FEAT-001]
- **Feature Name**: Core Editor Engine
- **Epic/Theme**: Core Editor
- **Priority**: High
- **Estimated Effort**: Large

## Business Context
### User Story
**As a** developer
**I want** a fast, responsive, and reliable core editor engine
**So that** I can edit code without any perceptible lag and with confidence that my work is safe.

### Business Value
- **Problem**: Traditional text editors can be slow and unresponsive, especially when working with large files.
- **Solution**: A high-performance editor engine built in Gleam, using modern data structures and algorithms.
- **Impact**: A significantly improved developer experience, leading to increased productivity and satisfaction.

### Success Criteria
- The editor can open and edit large files (e.g., >10MB) without any noticeable lag.
- Basic editing operations (insert, delete, undo/redo) are instantaneous.
- The editor provides accurate and incremental syntax highlighting.

## Functional Requirements
### Core Functionality
1. **Text Storage**:
   - Input: Text from a file or user input.
   - Processing: Store the text in a memory-efficient data structure like a rope.
   - Output: The text is available for editing and rendering.
2. **Editing Operations**:
   - Input: User input (keystrokes, mouse events).
   - Processing: Perform editing operations (insert, delete, etc.) on the text data structure.
   - Output: The text is updated and the changes are reflected in the UI.
3. **Syntax Highlighting**:
   - Input: The text and a grammar definition.
   - Processing: Use a fast parsing library like Tree-sitter to parse the text and generate a syntax tree.
   - Output: The syntax tree is available for rendering with different colors and styles.
4. **Undo/Redo**:
   - Input: User commands to undo or redo changes.
   - Processing: Maintain a history of changes and apply them to the text data structure.
   - Output: The text is reverted to a previous state.

## Technical Requirements
- **Text Storage**: A custom rope data structure will be implemented in Gleam. This data structure will be designed for high performance and memory efficiency.
- **Syntax Highlighting**: The editor will use Tree-sitter for parsing and syntax highlighting. We will use the existing `tree-sitter-gleam` grammar for Gleam code, and we will create a Gleam wrapper for the Tree-sitter library to integrate it with the editor.
- **API**: The core editor engine will expose a well-defined API for the UI layer and other components to interact with. This API will be asynchronous and non-blocking to ensure a responsive UI.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**:
  - Opening a 10MB file should take less than 100ms.
  - Basic editing operations should be completed in under 16ms (i.e., within a single frame at 60fps).
- **Reliability**: The editor engine should be robust and not crash or lose data, even when working with large files or complex editing operations.
- **Scalability**: The editor engine should be able to handle files of any size, limited only by the available memory.

## Implementation Guidelines
- The rope data structure will be implemented as a persistent data structure to allow for efficient undo/redo functionality.
- A Gleam wrapper for the Tree-sitter library will be implemented as a NIF (Native Implemented Function) to allow Gleam to call the C-based Tree-sitter library.
- The API will be designed with a focus on performance and ease of use.

## Edge Cases and Error Scenarios
- The editor should handle files with very long lines gracefully.
- The editor should handle files with mixed encodings.
- The editor should handle out-of-memory errors gracefully.

## Acceptance Criteria
- A comprehensive test suite for the rope data structure and the core editor engine.
- A set of benchmarks to measure the performance of the editor engine.
- A successful integration of the core editor engine with the UI layer.

## Dependencies and Constraints
- The project will depend on the Tree-sitter library and the `tree-sitter-gleam` grammar.
- The implementation of the rope data structure and the Tree-sitter wrapper will be a significant undertaking and will require careful design and implementation.

## Rollout Strategy
- The core editor engine will be developed and tested in isolation before being integrated with the rest of the editor.
- The rope data structure will be developed and tested separately before being integrated into the core editor engine.
