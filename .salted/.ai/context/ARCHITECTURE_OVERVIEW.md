# Architecture Overview

This document provides an overview of the system architecture for the `gl_ass` project.

## Architectural Principles

The architecture of the `gl_ass` project will be guided by the following principles, which are inspired by the Google SWE book:

- **Simplicity:** We will strive for a simple and easy-to-understand architecture. We will avoid unnecessary complexity and favor solutions that are easy to reason about.
- **Modularity:** The architecture will be modular, with well-defined interfaces between components. This will allow us to develop and test components in isolation and to replace them with new implementations in the future.
- **Testability:** The architecture will be designed to be easily testable, with a focus on unit testing and integration testing. We will use techniques like dependency injection to make our code more testable.
- **Scalability:** The architecture will be designed to scale to a large number of users and a large codebase. We will use technologies like Erlang/OTP to build a scalable and concurrent system.
- **Reliability:** The architecture will be designed to be reliable and resilient to failures. We will use techniques like supervision trees and circuit breakers to build a fault-tolerant system.

## System Architecture

The `gl_ass` project will have a modular architecture, consisting of a core editor and a set of packages that provide additional functionality. The editor will be built on the Erlang/OTP runtime, which will provide a robust and scalable foundation.

The architecture will follow the principles of Self-contained systems, MVVM + Hexagonal Architecture, and the 12 Factor App methodology. Communication between components will be handled by gleamrpc (a combination of Erlang and gRPC).
