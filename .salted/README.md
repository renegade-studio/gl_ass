# The .salted Framework

Welcome to the `.salted` framework, a comprehensive set of templates and workflows for spec-driven, AI-assisted software development.

## Philosophy

This framework is built on the principles of **Context Engineering**, **Specification-Driven Development**, and **Prompt Engineering**. The core idea is to structure all project information in a way that is easily consumable by both human developers and AI coding agents, enabling seamless collaboration and high-quality, automated development.

The philosophy for the `gl_ass` project, which is being built with this framework, is detailed in the `PHILOSOPHY.md` file. It is based on four pillars:
1.  **A 'Symbiotic' AI Core**
2.  **A 'Zero-Friction' Developer Experience**
3.  **'Time-Shifted' Collaboration**
4.  **'BEAM-Powered' Unbreakable Reliability**

## Purpose

The `.salted` framework is designed to be the "source of truth" for a project. By maintaining a rich, version-controlled context and clear, actionable specifications, we can empower AI agents to perform complex coding tasks with a high degree of accuracy and autonomy.

This instance of the framework is dedicated to the rewrite of the Atom editor into a new, high-performance editor named `gl_ass`, using the Gleam programming language.

## How to Use This Framework

1.  **Start with Context:** The `context/` directory contains the global understanding of the project. Always keep this up-to-date.
2.  **Define Features:** The `specs/features/` directory is where you define what needs to be built. Use the `template.md` to create new feature specifications.
3.  **Break Down Tasks:** The `tasks/` directory holds the specific, actionable work items derived from feature specs.
4.  **Leverage Prompts:** The `prompts/` directory contains templates for interacting with AI agents.
5.  **Follow Workflows:** The `workflows/` directory documents the development process, including code reviews and agent coordination.

Please see the `QUICK_START.md` for a step-by-step guide to initializing a new project with this framework.
